# Morning Commute

Join the community to discuss all things related to MassTransit.

### How to join

Download and install [Discord](https://discord.com/) then join the [MassTransit](https://discord.com/invite/rNpQgYn) server. Five minutes before the event starts a Morning Commute voice channel and a Morning Commute Chat text channel will appear.

Once the channels are available:

1. Join the "Morning Commute" voice channel
2. Switch over to the "Morning Commute Chat" channel (the voice channel will remain connected)
3. Listen to the conversation.
4. To join the conversation, "raise your hand" by asking to speak in the chat channel. Depending on participation, you may be granted speaking permissions upon joining.

If you are unable to join using Discord, sessions are simulcasted live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/phatboyg). Twitch chat may be used to submit questions during the session.

### Schedule

Sessions are scheduled the 1st and 3rd Tuesday, starting at 07:00 AM Central Time. [Check your local time zone](https://time.is/compare/0700_in_CDT).
