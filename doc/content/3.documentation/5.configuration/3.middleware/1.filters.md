## Kill Switch

A Kill Switch is used to prevent failing consumers from moving all the messages from the input queue to the error queue. By monitoring message consumption and tracking message successes and failures, a Kill Switch stops the receive endpoint when a trip threshold has been reached.

Typically, consumer exceptions are transient issues and suspending consumption until a later time when the transient issue may have been resolved.

::alert{type="info"}
A Kill Switch is the messaging analog of a Circuit Breaker, and operates in a similar manner. However, instead of inducing failure to reduce pressure on a backing service, the kill switch stops consuming messages instead thereby reducing pressure on backing services.

### Configuration

A Kill Switch can be configured on an individual receive endpoint or all receive endpoints on the bus. To configure a kill switch on all receive endpoints, add the _UseKillSwitch_ method as shown.

```csharp
var busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>
{
    cfg.UseKillSwitch(options => options
        .SetActivationThreshold(10)
        .SetTripThreshold(0.15)
        .SetRestartTimeout(m: 1));

    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint("some-queue", e =>
    {
        e.Consumer<SomeConsumer>();
    });
});
```

In the above example, the kill switch will activate after _10_ messages have been consumed. If the ratio of failures/attempts exceeds _15%_, the kill switch will trip and stop the receive endpoint. After _1_ minute, the receive endpoint will be restarted. Once restarted, if exceptions are still observed, the receive endpoint will be stopped again for _1_ minute.

To configure the kill switch on a receive endpoint, the syntax is the same as shown.

```csharp
var busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>
{
    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint("some-queue", e =>
    {
        e.UseKillSwitch(options => options
            .SetActivationThreshold(10)
            .SetTripThreshold(0.15)
            .SetRestartTimeout(m: 1));

        e.Consumer<SomeConsumer>();
    });
});
```

### Options

| Option                       | Description                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TrackingPeriod`       | The time window for tracking exceptions |
| `TripThreshold`        | The percentage of failed messages that triggers the kill switch. Should be 0-100, but seriously like 5-10. |
| `ActivationThreshold`  | The number of messages that must be consumed before the kill switch activates. |
| `RestartTimeout`       | The wait time before restarting the receive endpoint   |
| `ExceptionFilter`      | By default, all exceptions are tracked. An exception filter can be configured to only track specific exceptions. |



## Circuit Breaker

A circuit breaker is used to protect resources (remote, local, or otherwise) from being overloaded when
in a failure state. For example, a remote web site may be unavailable and calling that web site in a
message consumer takes 30-60 seconds to time out. By continuing to call the failing service, the service
may be unable to recover. A circuit breaker detects the repeated failures and trips, preventing further
calls to the service and giving it time to recover. Once the reset interval expires, calls are slowly allowed
back to the service. If it is still failing, the breaker remains open, and the timeout interval resets.
Once the service returns to healthy, calls flow normally as the breaker closes.

Read Martin Fowler's description of the pattern [here](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html).

To add the circuit breaker to a receive endpoint:

```csharp
e.UseCircuitBreaker(cb =>
{
    cb.TrackingPeriod = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
    cb.TripThreshold = 15;
    cb.ActiveThreshold = 10;
    cb.ResetInterval = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
});
```

### Options 

There are four options that can be adjusted on a circuit breaker.

| Option            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TrackingPeriod`  | The time window for tracking exceptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `TripThreshold`   | This is a percentage, and is based on the ratio of successful to failed attempts. When set to 15, if the ratio exceeds 15%, the circuit breaker opens and remains open until the `ResetInterval` expires.                                              |
| `ActiveThreshold` | that must reach the circuit breaker in a tracking period before the circuit breaker can trip. If set to 10, the trip threshold is not evaluated until at least 10 messages have been received.                                                         |
| `ResetInterval`   | The period of time between the circuit breaker trip and the first attempt to close the circuit breaker. Messages that reach the circuit breaker during the open period will immediately fail with the same exception that tripped the circuit breaker. |

## Rate Limiter

A rate limiter is used to restrict the number of messages processed within a time period. The reason may be
that an API or service only accepts a certain number of calls per minute, and will delay any subsequent attempts
until the rate limiting period has expired.

::alert{type="warning"}
The rate limiter will delay message delivery until the rate limit expires, so it is best to avoid large time windows
and keep the rate limits sane. Something like 1000 over 10 minutes is a bad idea, versus 100 over a minute. Try to
adjust the values and see what works for you.
::

There are two modes that a rate limiter can operate, but only one of them is currently supported (the other may come later).

To add a rate limiter to a receive endpoint:

```csharp
cfg.ReceiveEndpoint("customer_update_queue", e =>
{
    e.UseRateLimit(1000, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
    // other configuration
});
```

The two arguments supported by the rate limiter include:

### RateLimit
  The number of calls allowed in the time period.

### Interval
  The time interval before the message count is reset to zero.
